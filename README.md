# messaging

Developed by Hudson Molonglo in collaboration with GAIA Resources and Recordkeeping Innovation
as part of the Queensland State Archives Digital Archiving Program.

Things to do:

  * Make messages assignable to groups as well as users (separate field for "assignee_group").  Tests for this too.
  
  * Backend controller + endpoint to fetch message count for the current user.
  
  * Entirety of the UI :)
